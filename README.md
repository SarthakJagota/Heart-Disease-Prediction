# Heart-Disease-Prediction
📌 Overview

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient using machine learning algorithms. It uses a dataset containing various health parameters like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc., to build a predictive model. This can help in early diagnosis and preventive treatment of heart-related conditions.
🧪 Objective

To develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on clinical features.
🛠️ Technologies Used

    Python 🐍

    Pandas & NumPy – Data Handling

    Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization
